6. Versus Dactylicus herummr combam.
The rules of this verse ure well known; a spondeo

7. Versus Anapaesticus tetrameter actateetns.

Instead os en anapaest,a spondeo, dactyle, or proceleus-
mationa maybeused (— L -έ υ). The Greek
dramatic writers employ this verse in systems, conclud· ’
ing each witha dimeter catalectus trisyllabum, which

is then* called cernes porrectiores. Seneca never uses

this conclusion, and thus impeirs very much the effect
of this mette. An anapaeetic dimeter, which ir occa·
