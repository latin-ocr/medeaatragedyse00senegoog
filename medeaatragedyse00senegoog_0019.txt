Medea with seigned bumility condescends,

As to the language, it may be sufficient to
mention its purity, aud its lreedom from those
indications of degeneracy by which the works
,of almost all the contemporaries of Seneca,
and some of his own, are marred. The style
is simplet than that of most of the other tra·
gedies; the dialogue in particular is not ren-
dered affected and unnatural hythe constant
interchange ol sententious remarks, which is
a very striking desect ol the Thyestes and the
Troades, rich storebouses, indeed, ol apo:

thegms and mottos sor those who are fond of ‚

gamishing their discourse with scraps ol Latin
and Greek.

tion of J. F. Gronovius, based upon the mauu·

script which be found in the Florentiae library, Ι

undoubtedly the best, although not perfect. The
Editor caunot hut remark how severely he has
felt, in the course of his labor, the wantos mod·
eru editions, among which he would mention

that ol F. H. Bothe, 1819, and that of Levte

and Duval, 1823.
